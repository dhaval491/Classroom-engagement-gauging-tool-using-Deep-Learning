# Classroom-engagement-gauging-tool-using-Deep-Learning
A deep nueral network that takes live video stream from an online meeting and determines the level of focus/engagement of person attending the meeting.

**Taks
->Face Detection from a video Stream and cropping the instance image.
->Feeding the input image to the DNN model whose output is the average engagement level of 30 seconds
-> Calculating overall engagement level for content quality, presentation quality etc**

Sample images of determination of engagement level. 

Sample Output where my teammate has eyes closed and I am focusing on the sceen

Sample Output where my freind is looking away and I am focusing down to my notes, we made our network robust learn what is meant by  to focus (on scree and down to notes)
